.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmnetx-generate
creates and operates on
.B vmnetx
compatible virtual machines.
.B vmnetx-generate
provides a suite for adding new blank virtual machines to
.BR virt-manager ,
validating domain XML, and generating
.I .nxpk
virtual machine packages from existing virtual machine images.
.SS Virtual Machine Lifecycle
Virtual machines are created in
.B virt-manager
using the
.B vmnetx-generate -a
command.  The user must then open 
.B virt-manager
and install and configure the virtual machine. If a memory image is desired, the
VM should be suspended.  If the VM is executed or modified in
.B virt-manager
then the domain XML may no longer conform to the VMNetX requirements, so it
should be hand-modified until
.B vmnetx-generate -c
no longer prints validation errors to standard output.
.PP
Once no errors are returned by
.B vmnetx-generate -c
then a VMNetX virtual machine package can be generate using
.BR vmnetx-generate .
The resulting 
.I .nxpk
file can be uploaded to a webserver and downloaded and executed.
.PP
To enable users to execute the virtual machine without downloading the entire package, you must create a reference file using
.BR vmnetx-generate\ -r .
This file should be uploaded to the webserver with the
.I .netx
extension and the
.I application/x-vmnetx-reference+xml
content type. The link to this
.I .netx
file should be published for access.

.SH MODES
vmnetx-generate has several modes of operation:

.TP
.B Create
Create a new blank virtual machine in
.B virt-manager
for use when creating a VMNetX package.

.TP
.B Validate
Validate the domain XML of a virtual machine before generating a
.I .nxpk
package to ensure compliance across libvirt/qemu versions.
.I vmnetx
restricts valid domain XML to ensure compatibility. This is done automatically
when using
.B vmnetx-generate
in Package mode.

.TP
.B Package
Package the domain XML, virtual disk, and memory image of the virtual machine
in order to upload the virtual machine for remote access.
.I vmnetx
only recognizes its own
.I .nxpk
packages or
.I .netx
reference files for execution. This mode also validates the supplied domain XML.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B \-\^\-version
Print the version number of
.B vmnetx-generate
to the standard output stream, then exit.
.TP 
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Print a usage message summarizing these options, then exit.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-add=
Create a blank virtual machine and add it to
.BR virt-manager .
The argument given to this flag is the short name associated with the VM in the
.B virt-manager
interface, and is used as the filename of the domain XML.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-check\-xml=
Validate domain XML for a virtual machine.
The argument given to this flag is the path of the domain XML.
.TP 
.BR \-n ", " \-\-name=
Name of the virtual machine package to create where the argument is the friendly name displayed in the titlebar of VMNetX.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reference=
Create a reference file to a remote VMNetX package to enable users to execute the virtual machine without downloading the full package.
The argument given to this flag is the URL of the referenced
.I .nxpk
package.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-uncompressed
Do not compress memory and disk images at package creation.  Used with the
.B \-n
flag.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B "  vmnetx-generate \-n windows3.1 ~/.libvirt/qemu/windows311.xml ~/windows311.nxpk"
.br
Creates a
.I .nxpk
file in the user's home directory. This is a VMNetX package which is ready to be uploaded to a webserver or accessed remotely.

.B "  vmnetx-generate \-r http://example.com/package.nxpk ~/package.netx"
.br
Creates an executable
.I .netx
file in the user's home directory.  This file contains a reference to the remote 
.I .nxpk
file and can be executed by VMNetX to run the referenced VM without downloading the full package.

.B "  vmnetx-generate \-a dos622 1024 1"
.br
Creates a new blank virtual machine named
.I dos622
with
.I 1024
MB of allocated RAM and
.I 1
GB of allocated disk space and adds it to
.BR virt-manager .

.B "  vmnetx-generate \-c ~/.libvirt/qemu/macos.xml"
.br
Checks domain XML at the supplied path for VMNetX compatibility.
