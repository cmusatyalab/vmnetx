.TH VMNETX-EXAMPLE-FRONTEND 8 2014-02-21 "VMNetX @version@" "System Administration"

.SH NAME
vmnetx-example-frontend \- Simple web frontend for VMNetX server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
.RI [ CONFIG-FILE... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
is a sample implementation of a web frontend for remote execution of VMNetX
virtual machines.

In the intended usage model, virtual machine image servers redirect clients
to the
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
.IR launch\ URL ,
specifying a
.I package
query parameter giving the URL to a
.I .nxpk
package on the image server.
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
then authenticates the user, creates a VM instance in the configured
.BR vmnetx-server (8),
and returns a
.I .netx
file to the client.
When the user opens this file,
.BR vmnetx (1)
will be launched against that VM instance.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Print a usage message summarizing these options, then exit.

.TP
.B \-\^\-version
Print the version number of
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
and exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is written in Python.  It supports the following
attributes:

.TP
.IR AUTH_REALM \ (default:\ 'Example\ VMNetX\ Frontend')
The HTTP authentication realm that should be displayed when requesting
authentication from clients.

.TP
.IR AUTH_USERS \ (no\ default)
A dictionary of authentication credentials for users who should be permitted
to launch VMs.
Dictionary keys are usernames; values are the corresponding plaintext
passwords.
Passwords should not be considered secure, as they are stored and
transmitted without encryption.

.TP
.IR DEBUG \ (default:\ False)
Whether to enable debugging.

.TP
.IR HOST \ (default:\ '0.0.0.0')
The address on which
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
should listen for HTTP connections.

.TP
.IR PORT \ (default:\ 8000)
The TCP port on which
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
should listen for HTTP connections.

.TP
.IR REQUIRE_HTTPS \ (default:\ True)
Whether to reject virtual machine images that are not served over an HTTPS
connection.

.TP
.IR SECRET_KEY \ (no\ default)
The authentication key required by the
.BR vmnetx-server (8)
instance in which virtual machines will be launched.

.TP
.IR SERVER \ (default:\ 'http://localhost:18924/')
The URL to the
.BR vmnetx-server (8)
instance.

.TP
.IR TRUSTED_VM_HOSTS \ (no\ default)
A whitelist of virtual machine image servers which are trusted to provide
VMNetX packages.
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
will refuse to launch VMs that are not served from one of the hostnames
in this list.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
VMNETX_FRONTEND_SETTINGS
The path to a configuration file that should be read before the files
specified on the command line.

.SH EXAMPLE
A minimal configuration for a
.BR vmnetx-server (8)
running on
.IR cloud.example.org :

.in +4n
.nf
host: cloud.example.org
secret_key: secr3t
.fi
.in

The corresponding configuration for a
.B vmnetx-example-frontend
running on the same machine:

.in +4n
.nf
AUTH_USERS = {
    'bovik': 'tenure'
}
SECRET_KEY = 'secr3t'
TRUSTED_VM_HOSTS = ['images.example.org']
.fi
.in

With these settings,
.I images.example.org
can redirect clients to:

.in +4n
.I http://cloud.example.org/launch?package=https://images.example.org/image-1.nxpk
.in

.B vmnetx-example-frontend
will authenticate each client against the
.I AUTH_USERS
dictionary, create a VM instance in the configured
.BR vmnetx-server (8),
and return a
.I .netx
file directing the client to connect to that VM instance.
