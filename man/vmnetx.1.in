.SH NAME
vmnetx \- Virtual Machine Network Execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmnetx
.RI [ \ OPTIONS \ ] \ LOCATION
.\" .sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmnetx
executes a
.BR kvm -based
virtual machine whose VMNetX reference file or package is located at the supplied 
.IR LOCATION .
The supplied path should point to either a
.I .netx
file or a 
.I .nxpk
file.
.PP
VMNetX allows virtual machines to be stored on a web server and executed
on-demand on a client system. The entire disk and memory state are not
downloaded before starting the VM; instead, disk and memory chunks are
retrieved on demand from the web server and then cached on the client.

.SS Local and Remote VMs
VMNetX can handle either local or remote virtual machine images.  If the
.I .nxpk
file is stored locally, you can invoke the VMNetX package directly with
.BI vmnetx \ /path/to/vm.nxpk \fR.
.PP
When
.B vmnetx
is invoked with a URL to a remote virtual machine package, the virtual machine
is streamed from the remote URL as though a reference
.I .netx
file were supplied.
.PP
The alternative method for accessing VMNetX formatted virtual machine packages
is to supply the path to a local
.I .netx
file, which contains a reference URL to a remote VMNetX package. This approach
allows package creators to provide small reference files for download for users
navigating with web browsers rather than supplying the entire package as a URL
which would download the full VM image and associated packaged data.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\^\-version
Print the version number of
.B vmnetx
to the standard output stream, then exit.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Print a usage message summarizing these options, then exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B "  vmnetx windows311.nxpk"
.br
Executes the virtual machine bundled in the
.I windows311.nxpk
package located in the current working directory.

.B "  vmnetx http://example.com/windows311.nxpk"
.br
Downloads the virtual machine package
.I windows311.nxpk
from the supplied URL and executes it.

.B "  vmnetx windows311.netx"
.br
Executes the virtual machine whose reference file is called
.I windows311.netx
in the current working directory.
