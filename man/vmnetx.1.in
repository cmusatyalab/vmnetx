.SH NAME
vmnetx \- Virtual Machine Network Execution

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmnetx
.RI [ \ OPTIONS \ ] \ LOCATION
.\" .sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmnetx
allows virtual machines to be stored on a web server and executed
on-demand on a client system.
The entire disk and memory state are not downloaded before starting the VM;
instead, disk and memory chunks are retrieved on demand from the web server
and then cached on the client.
.B vmnetx
can also provide remote access to a virtual machine running on an execution
server.

.PP
.I LOCATION
can be the path to a virtual machine package in the local filesystem,
the HTTP or HTTPS URL for a package on a remote server, or the
.I vmnetx://
URL to a virtual machine configured on a remote server.
.B vmnetx
also supports
.IR reference\ files ,
which are small documents containing the URL for a remote package or
virtual machine.
If
.I LOCATION
is a path to a reference file,
.B vmnetx
will launch the virtual machine to which the file refers.
